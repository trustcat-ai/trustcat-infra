## Onboarding Process

### Step 1: Register on CatChain

Submit your rig specs + **$100 USDC registration fee** to get verified:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trustcat.ai/provider/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_id": "your_provider_id",
    "rig_specs": {
      "gpu_model": "RTX 5090",
      "gpu_count": 1,
      "gpu_vram_gb": 32,
      "cpu_model": "AMD 7950X",
      "cpu_cores": 16,
      "ram_gb": 64,
      "storage_tb": 2,
      "network_speed_gbps": 10,
      "location": "US-East"
    },
    "catchain_address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
    "usdc_payment_tx": "0xRegistrationFeeTxHash"
  }'
```

**What happens next:**
1. We verify your payment on Base L2
2. Your rig specs get logged on CatChain (Block #X)
3. You receive k3s cluster credentials within 24h

### Step 2: Install k3s Agent

Once approved, you'll receive an installation script:
```bash
# Provided after registration approval
curl -sfL https://install.trustcat.ai/k3s-agent.sh | \
  K3S_URL=https://k3s.trustcat.ai:6443 \
  K3S_TOKEN=your_secret_token \
  sh -
```

**Manual verification:**
```bash
# Check k3s is running
sudo systemctl status k3s-agent

# Verify GPU access in k3s
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl describe node your-node-name | grep -i nvidia
```

### Step 3: Configure Monitoring

Install our monitoring stack to track uptime and job performance:
```bash
# Install Prometheus node exporter
sudo docker run -d \
  --name node-exporter \
  --net="host" \
  --pid="host" \
  -v "/:/host:ro,rslave" \
  prom/node-exporter:latest \
  --path.rootfs=/host

# Install NVIDIA GPU exporter
sudo docker run -d \
  --name nvidia-exporter \
  --gpus all \
  -p 9835:9835 \
  mindprince/nvidia_gpu_prometheus_exporter:latest
```

**Access your dashboard:** `https://monitor.trustcat.ai/provider/your_id`

### Step 4: Test Job Execution

We'll send a test workload to verify everything works:
```bash
# You'll see a test pod deployed to your node
kubectl get pods -n test-provider-001

# Check logs
kubectl logs -n test-provider-001 test-job-xxxxx
```

**Expected output:** CUDA test passes, GPU utilization logged.

### Example Earnings
| Job Type | Duration | Rate | Your Cut (95%) |
|----------|----------|------|----------------|
| AI Training | 24h | $500 | $475 |
| Rendering | 12h | $300 | $285 |
| Inference | 1h | $50 | $47.50 |

**Average provider with 1x RTX 5090:** $3k-$8k/month depending on utilization.

## FAQ

**Q: What if my rig goes offline during a job?**  
A: Client is refunded, you don't get paid. Maintain 99%+ uptime to stay in good standing.

**Q: Can I run other workloads on my rig simultaneously?**  
A: No. When a job is assigned, 100% of resources must be dedicated to the client.

**Q: What happens if I want to leave the network?**  
A: Give 7 days notice. Complete any active jobs, then remove the k3s agent. Registration fee is non-refundable.

**Q: How do I handle security/privacy for client workloads?**  
A: All jobs run in isolated k8s namespaces. You don't see client data, just resource utilization metrics.

**Q: What's the registration fee for?**  
A: Covers CatChain block creation, k3s setup, and ensures serious providers only.
